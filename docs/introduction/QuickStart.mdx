# Quick Start

<Note>

### What You'll Learn

- What Redux is, and why you should use it
- How Redux relates to React
- How to set up and start using Redux quickly
- What a small working React+Redux app looks like

### Prerequisites

There are several things you should know in advance before learning Redux:

- Basic familiarity with HTML & CSS, and the DOM.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming.
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features.
- Basic knowledge of React, including components, props, and state.
- Node.js and `npm` installed globally.

</Note>

## What Is Redux?

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It acts as the data layer inside an application.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently and can run in different environments (client, server, and native).
It also helps you to write code that is testable, and enables you to better understand when, where, why, and how the data in your
application has changed.

Redux does this by asking you to:

- Place some data (**_"state"_**) into a special object called a **_"store"_**
- Write separate functions called **_"reducers"_** that know how to update the state inside the store
- Follow specific rules for how your code can update and read the state

### What does Redux include?

The core Redux library consists of a few API functions. The most important API is the `createStore` function.

**TODO** figure out what else to put here, or if this should be dropped

### How does Redux work with a UI?

Redux, by itself, is a plain JavaScript library. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other UI view library.

To help make this possible, there are additional bindings libraries that connect together a Redux store and your UI components. Each different
UI framework has its own specific bindings library. For example, the [React-Redux library](https://react-redux.js.org) allows your React components to read values from a Redux store,
and tell the store to calculate an update to the state inside.

### What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux itself is small and unopinionated. We also have a separate addon package called [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org), which includes some opinionated defaults
that help you use Redux more effectively, and includes packages that we think are essential to building a Redux app.
It's our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. As with the Redux core, you can use Redux Toolkit with any UI layer.

## Goals

We're going to create a small application with React and Redux together. The app will be a simple employee database, and we'll learn:

- How to set up Redux with React
- The data flow lifecycle of a Redux app
- How to write Redux logic that updates data, and shows the updated data in the UI
- How to create, update, view, and delete users (employees) from the system
- How to make API calls for each of the above actions

## Setup and Installation

### Create a React Project

We'll start by creating an empty React project. You can do this in one of two ways: creating a local project on your own computer with the
Create-React-App tool, or creating a project in the CodeSandbox web app.

#### Create a Local Project with Create-React-App

[Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is the official tool for creating new React projects.

Create a new React project named `redux-employee-example` by running this command:

```bash
npx create-react-app redux-employee-example
```

Then, install the required Redux packages, using either the NPM or Yarn package manager:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Create an Online Project with CodeSandbox

[CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) is an online IDE that lets you create entire web applications in your browser, without needing to
install anything locally.

Create a new React project sandbox by browsing to the [CodeSandbox "Create Sandbox" page](https://codesandbox.io/s/) and selecting the official React template.

Once the sandbox has been created, click the "Add Dependency" button on the left, search for `@reduxjs/toolkit`, add it, and then do the same for `react-redux`.

### Create a Redux Store

The React project starts with a single `<App>` component that shows some "hello" text on the page. Our first goal is to create a Redux store instance
that holds some data inside, and update the `<App>` component to read that data and show it instead.

To create a Redux store, start by updating the `index.js` file to import the `configureStore` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package.

```diff
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
+import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In order to actually create a Redux store, we need to define our first "reducer" function. Reducers are functions that know how to
calculate a new state value when asked. A Redux store must always be given a single reducer function when it is created, which we call the
"root reducer" to say that it is the starting point for any other reducer functions inside.

For now, we can create a small root reducer function that always returns a string, like this:

```diff
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

import App from "./App";

+function rootReducer() {
+    return "Hello Redux!";
+}


const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```
