# Quick Start

<Note>

### What You'll Learn

- What Redux is, and why you should use it
- How Redux relates to React
- How to set up and start using Redux quickly
- What a small working React+Redux app looks like

### Prerequisites

There are several things you should know in advance before learning Redux:

- Basic familiarity with HTML & CSS, and the DOM.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming.
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features.
- Basic knowledge of React, including components, props, and state.
- Node.js and `npm` installed globally.

</Note>

## What Is Redux?

**Redux** is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It acts as the data layer inside an application.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently and can run in different environments (client, server, and native).
It also helps you to write code that is testable, and enables you to better understand when, where, why, and how the data in your
application has changed.

Redux does this by asking you to:

- Place some data (**_"state"_**) into a special object called a **_"store"_**
- Write separate functions called **_"reducers"_** that know how to update the state inside the store
- Follow specific rules for how your code can update and read the state

### What does Redux include?

The core Redux library consists of a few API functions. The most important API is the `createStore` function.

<Note type="error">

**TODO** figure out what else to put here, or if this should be dropped

</Note>

### How does Redux work with a UI?

Redux, by itself, is a plain JavaScript library. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other UI view library.

To help make this possible, there are additional bindings libraries that connect together a Redux store and your UI components. Each different
UI framework has its own specific bindings library. For example, the [React-Redux library](https://react-redux.js.org) allows your React components to read values from a Redux store,
and tell the store to calculate an update to the state inside.

### What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux itself is small and unopinionated. We also have a separate addon package called [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org), which includes some opinionated defaults
that help you use Redux more effectively, and includes packages that we think are essential to building a Redux app.
It's our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. As with the Redux core, you can use Redux Toolkit with any UI layer.

## Goals

We're going to create a small application with React and Redux together. The app will be a simple employee database, and we'll learn:

- How to set up Redux with React
- The data flow lifecycle of a Redux app
- How to write Redux logic that updates data, and shows the updated data in the UI
- How to create, update, view, and delete users (employees) from the system
- How to make API calls for each of the above actions

## Setup and Installation

### Create a React Project

We'll start by creating an empty React project. You can do this in one of two ways: creating a local project on your own computer with the
Create-React-App tool, or creating a project in the CodeSandbox web app.

#### Create a Local Project with Create-React-App

[Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is the official tool for creating new React projects.

Create a new React project named `redux-employee-example` by running this command:

```bash
npx create-react-app redux-employee-example
```

Then, install the required Redux packages, using either the NPM or Yarn package manager:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Create an Online Project with CodeSandbox

[CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) is an online IDE that lets you create entire web applications in your browser, without needing to
install anything locally.

Create a new React project sandbox by browsing to the [CodeSandbox "Create Sandbox" page](https://codesandbox.io/s/) and selecting the official React template.

Once the sandbox has been created, click the "Add Dependency" button on the left, search for `@reduxjs/toolkit`, add it, and then do the same for `react-redux`.

### Create a Redux Store

The React project starts with a single `<App>` component that shows some "hello" text on the page. Our first goal is to create a Redux store instance
that holds some data inside, and update the `<App>` component to read that data and show it instead.

<Note type="success">

#### Key Concept: "Store"

A Redux **_store_** is a special object that holds some data inside, such as a list of users that was fetched from the server.  
The data inside the store object is called **_state_**.

Each Redux store has three functions that you can call to interact with it:

- `store.getState()` returns the current state value inside the store
- `store.dispatch()` lets you tell the store that something has happened, and it should calculate a new state value in response
- `store.subscribe()` lets you run some code whenever the store has been updated

</Note>

To create a Redux store, start by updating the `index.js` file to import the `configureStore` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package.

```js {3}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import App from './App'

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement)
```

In order to actually create a Redux store, we need to define our first "reducer" function.

<Note type="success">

#### Key Concept: "Reducers"

A **_reducer_** is a function that know how to calculate a new state value when asked. A Redux store requires a single reducer function
when it is created, which we call the "root reducer" to say that it is the starting point for any other reducer functions inside.

Every reducer is called with two arguments: the current `state`, and an object called an **`action`**. We'll look at actions a bit later.

Reducers must always follow certain rules inside. As a quick summary:

- Reducers must always return a state value, never `undefined`
- Reducers can only decide what the next state value should be by looking at the `state` and `action` arguments
- Reducers are not allowed to make changes to the `state` argument, or anything else. They can only create the new state value by making copies of the originals, and updating the copies.

</Note>

For now, we can create a small root reducer function that always returns a string, like this:

```js {7-9}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import App from './App'

function rootReducer(state, action) {
  return 'Hello Redux!'
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement)
```

Now we can create our first Redux store. We pass in the `rootReducer` function as a parameter. The store will call the reducer function,
take whatever value it returns, and save that value inside as the current "state". We can then ask the store what its current state value is.

```js {11-15}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import App from './App'

function rootReducer(state, action) {
  return 'Hello Redux!'
}

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer
})

console.log(store.getState())

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement)
```

If you look at the console in your browser's DevTools (or in CodeSandbox), you should see that the words `"Hello Redux!"` were printed.

### Set Up the Provider Component

We've got a Redux store with its state inside, but now we need to find a way to use that state inside our `<App>` component.

It's _possible_ that we could move the store into a separate file, import that store into the `App.js` file, and call `store.getState()`. But, as the
app gets bigger, we'd have to import the store into _every_ file. That's not a good idea.

This is where the React-Redux library comes in. It gives us a way to read data from the store in any component in our application, without needing
to import the store into every file.

To do this, we need to pass the store into a React-Redux `<Provider>` component.

<Note type="success">

#### Key Concept: `<Provider>`

The React-Redux library has a `<Provider>` component. It uses [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to pass the Redux store
to all components inside of itself.

Every React-Redux app needs to put a `<Provider>` component around the main `<App>` component so that the whole app can use the store.

</Note>

We'll import the `Provider` component type from React-Redux, render a `<Provider>` around our `<App>`, and then pass the store to the `<Provider>`. (We'll also remove the console log, since we don't need that any more.)

```js {4,18-25}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

import App from './App'

function rootReducer(state, action) {
  return 'Hello Redux!'
}

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer
})

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  rootElement
)
```

### Show the State in the App Component

The last step for the initial setup is to update our `<App>` component to read the state value from the Redux store.

We've already seen that the React-Redux `<Provider>` component makes the store available to any components inside. To go along with that, React-Redux
includes a React hook called `useSelector`, which React function components can call to retrieve the state values from the store.

<Note type="success">

#### Key Concept: "Selectors"

A **_selector_** is a function that takes the Redux store state as an argument, and returns some part of that store state.

The React-Redux `useSelector()` hook takes a selector function, calls the selector by passing in the store state, and then returns
the selector function's return value to your component.

You can also use selector functions elsewhere in your Redux code as well.

</Note>

Open up `App.js`, and rewrite it to look like this:

```js {2,5-7,10,14}
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import './styles.css'

function selectHelloText(state) {
  return state
}

export default function App() {
  const helloText = useSelector(selectHelloText)

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{helloText}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We import the `useSelector` function from React-Redux, and then create a function called `selectHelloText`. It receives whatever state is in the Redux
store as an argument. For now, we'll just return that entire state value.

Inside the component, we call `useSelector` and pass in `selectHelloText`. When `useSelector` runs, it will call our selector function with the store
state, and pass the return value to our component.

Finally, we can put the text value into the header of our `<App>` component... and there it is!

**You should now see the words "Hello Redux" on screen. Congratulations! You've set up Redux in your app.**

Now that the setup is complete, we can start building the actual application logic.
